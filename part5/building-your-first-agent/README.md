# Setting up the environment

To set up the environment, you can use `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` to create a virtual environment for the project. After setting up the virtual environment, you can install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Once you have set up the virtual environment and installed the required packages, you can activate the virtual environment.

For example, to set up the virtual environment, you can use the following commands:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.0 developers-guide-to-ai-part5-first-agent
pyenv activate developers-guide-to-ai-part5-first-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
