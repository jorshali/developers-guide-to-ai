- Follow the instructions in: [Install Python](https://github.com/jorshali/developers-guide-to-ai/blob/main/README.md#install-python-if-necessary)

Navigate to the project (e.g. `part3/vector_databases`) directory in your terminal and run:

```
~/ai-for-devs/part3/vector_databases % python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run a Python Script
