# The Developer's Guide to AI - From Prompts to Agents

## Introduction

Python scripts that illustrate how to get structured data (JSON) from an LLM. It includes examples of sentiment analysis and data extraction using both the Ollama SDK and the `instructor` library.

## Prerequisites

The following steps will get you up and running on your machine.

Install Ollama (if necessary):

- Follow the instructions in: [Install Ollama](https://github.com/jorshali/developers-guide-to-ai/blob/main/README.md#install-ollama)

Install Python (if necessary):

- Follow the instructions in: [Install Python](https://github.com/jorshali/developers-guide-to-ai/blob/main/README.md#install-python-if-necessary)

Navigate to the project (e.g. `part2/structured_output`) directory in your terminal and run:

```
~/ai-for-devs/part2/structured_output % python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run a Python Script

In a terminal, navigate to the project directory (e.g. `part2/structured_output`) and run the following command:

```
~/ai-for-devs/part2/structured_output % python sentiment_analysis_ollama_sdk.py
```
