# About the Book

Most developers already know AI is powerful. What they don’t know is how to actually use it in their own codebase without becoming a data scientist. Too often, AI features stall out at brittle prototypes, half-baked search functions, or “smart” features that collapse the moment requirements change. That’s where this book comes in. We wrote this book with the everyday software developer in mind. The dev who works in a company and wants to grow their career by meeting the demands of the industry without losing time in the areas that might not be relevant to their current company or role.

Written by seasoned developers Jacob Orshalick, Jerry M. Reghunadh, and Danny Thompson, this book teaches you how to integrate and customize large language models (LLMs) and other pre-trained AI models to solve real-world problems. 

Instead of drowning you in theory, this book gives you:

- Intelligent automation: Automate repetitive work by calling LLMs directly from your own applications and streaming intelligent responses to the UI.
- Practical Paths: Build production-ready AI features with tools you already know and some you don't.
- Clarity through the hype: Learn where AI actually makes sense in your applications (and where it doesn’t).
- Fewer dead-ends: Avoid wasted cycles by understanding limitations, costs, and trade-offs before you build.
- Competitive edge: Discover how AI can help you improve search, personalization, automation, and more.

We focus on practical applications using pre-trained AI models (LLMs and more) through accessible APIs and SDKs, allowing you to build AI-powered applications in the languages you already know.

# Parts Overview

## Part 1: Getting Started with AI
This part provides the foundation for working with AI, featuring both JavaScript and Python implementations.

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [part1/client/](part1/client/) | A React-based frontend application that consumes the LLM API. It demonstrates how to handle streaming responses from the server and manage UI states, providing a simple interface to ask questions and see the LLM's response in real-time. |
| [part1/getting_started/](part1/getting_started/) | Contains two Express.js server implementations. `section1` provides a basic REST service that interfaces with a local LLM using LangChain. `section2` enhances this by implementing real-time streaming of LLM responses, showing how to create a more responsive user experience. |
| [part1/getting_started_python/](part1/getting_started_python/) | A FastAPI-based Python alternative to the JavaScript server. It showcases Python's asynchronous capabilities for LLM interactions, including streaming support, and demonstrates how to integrate with the same LLM backend using Python's ecosystem. |

---

## Part 2: Prompt Engineering
This part dives deeper into LLM capabilities with practical examples of prompt engineering techniques.

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [part2/basic_examples/](part2/basic_examples/) | A collection of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental prompt engineering concepts. It includes examples of temperature settings, tokenization, prompt templates, and guard rails to control LLM behavior. |
| [part2/basic_examples_javascript/](part2/basic_examples_javascript/) | JavaScript examples covering chunking, creating embeddings, and tokenization. These scripts show how to perform common NLP tasks in a JavaScript environment. |
| [part2/first_call_chain/](part2/first_call_chain/) | A simple FastAPI server that demonstrates how to create a basic LLM chain using LangChain. It shows how to combine a prompt template with an LLM to answer questions. |

| [part3/parent_document_retriever_rag/](part3/parent_document_retriever_rag/) | A RAG implementation that uses the `ParentDocumentRetriever` to handle large documents. This approach splits documents into smaller chunks for embedding and retrieval, but returns the larger parent document for better context. |

# Python Environments \[Recommended\]

It's recommended that you setup a Python virtual environment for running the Python examples.  To setup the environment, you can use `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` to create a virtual environment for each project. After setting up the virtual environment, you can install the required packages using `pip`.

_Note:_  There are many tools for creating virtual environments in Python.  Feel free to choose your own preferred option.

## Install `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`

Follow the instructions found here to setup `pyenv` for your environment:

[Install pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

[Install pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Install Python version 3.13.5

The following command installs the necessary Python version using `pyenv`:

```
pyenv install 3.13.5
```

## Virtual Environment Setup

Setup your virtual environment with the installed Python version:

```
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.13.5 developers-guide-to-ai-part1
```

Each part of the book has a specific set of dependencies for its examples defined in a `requirements.txt` file.  When you get to a new part, you can create a specific environment by running the command above and simply changing the `part` number.

Now you need to activate your virtual environment:

```
$ pyenv activate developers-guide-to-ai-part1
```

Now that you've activate the virtual environment, you can navigate to the example directory and install the required packages using `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
